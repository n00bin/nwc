# Companion proc measurement tests

Two things we cannot read off a tooltip, written as repeatable in-game procedures.
Both use the character sheet as the measuring instrument, because it reports the
live value of every rating.

Record results at the bottom of this file, then Claude writes them into the data.

## Ruling and current state (n00b, 2026-09-11)

24 of our 30 enhancements describe themselves as **"Chance on hit to ..."**. All 24
are now flagged `conditional` in the data, which means Toon Forge keeps them **out of
the at-rest stat panel** and shows them in the **combat / Show conditional** view.
That is the ruling: in practice the proc is up almost continuously once a fight is
going, so it belongs behind the combat buff rather than in the unbuffed sheet.

Before this change only Perfect Vision was flagged, so the other 23 were inflating the
at-rest panel. **161 companions** carried a self-affecting one. The other 81 use
enemy-scope debuffs, which the engine already skipped.

The five **Enduring** enhancements say "While your companion is summoned and not
downed" and remain genuinely always-on. **Reinvigorate has no description text at all**
in our data and is left unflagged until someone reads its tooltip.

**What the test is still for:** we want the real proc chance, so the card can state it
instead of only saying "chance on hit". The modelling question is settled; the number
is not.

## Test A — is an enhancement a proc, and what are its numbers?

Run this once on **any one** chance-on-hit enhancement first. If it behaves as a proc,
the finding applies to the class and we only spot-check the rest.

Subject: **Perfect Vision** (n00b's pick). It buffs your Accuracy directly, so your own
character sheet moves, and it is carried by 15 companions including Abyssal Chicken.

**What we are trying to learn**
1. Does the buff show on the character sheet while standing still, out of combat?
2. What triggers it?
3. Roughly how often does it fire?
4. How long does it last after you stop attacking?

**Steps**

1. Summon a companion carrying **Perfect Vision** (Abyssal Chicken works). Stand
   somewhere safe, out of combat, and let every buff drop. Open the character sheet
   and write down your exact **Accuracy**.
2. Unsummon the companion. Read the same stat again and write it down. The
   difference between steps 1 and 2 is what the enhancement gives you **at rest**.
   If the difference is zero, it is a proc and our always-on modelling is wrong.
3. Re-summon, go to a target dummy, and attack continuously while watching that
   stat on the character sheet. Write down the highest value it reaches. Subtract
   the step 2 reading to get the **proc size**.
4. Stop attacking and keep watching. Write down how many seconds pass before the
   stat drops back. That is the **duration**. The tooltips claim 15 seconds.
5. Restart the fight from a clean state and count how many hits you land before
   the buff first appears. Repeat five times and note each count. That gives us a
   rough **chance per hit**.

**Record**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Enhancement tested | Perfect Vision |
| Stat | Accuracy |
| At rest, companion summoned | |
| At rest, companion unsummoned | |
| Peak during combat | |
| Duration after last hit | |
| Hits to first proc (5 trials) | |

## Test B — what does Kelemvor's Sword actually grant?

Acolyte of Kelemvor's **Kelemvor's Sword** grants Critical Avoidance "based on your
companions level and total Critical Avoidance". It prints no number, so we cannot
store a value or score it in the optimizer.

**Steps**

1. Summon Acolyte of Kelemvor. Out of combat, write down your own **Critical
   Avoidance** from the character sheet, and the companion's Critical Avoidance
   from its own stats page.
2. Enter combat and let the companion cast Kelemvor's Sword. Write down the highest
   Critical Avoidance your sheet reaches, and how long it lasts.
3. Change the companion's own Critical Avoidance by a large amount, by swapping its
   runestones or gear, and write down the new companion figure.
4. Repeat step 2 with the new setup and write down the new peak.
5. Two readings at different companion Critical Avoidance values let us work out
   whether the grant is a flat share, a percentage of the companion's stat, or
   scales with its level.

**Record**

| Trial | Companion Critical Avoidance | Your CA at rest | Your CA peak | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
