### Features
- **Toon Forge — "Assume support party" toggle.** New switch in the Party Buffs
  section makes your build account for the support companions your allies bring
  (Tutor, Flapjack, Portobello DaVinci, etc.). Off by default — matches the
  Part-of-the-Pack and Providence group toggles. A **Fill standard set** button
  loads the common support trio in one click, all editable, and you can slot any
  party-buff companion you like. When off, the ally slots are dimmed and
  contribute nothing.

### Bug Fixes
- **Detector's set (Unstable Drive) was double-counted.** The Detector's Choker
  listed its "Unstable Scan" bonus twice in the data, so the engine applied
  **14% Combat Advantage / Forte / Outgoing Healing instead of 7%**. Removed the
  duplicate so the set now shows its true value. (This was also making the build
  optimizer over-favor the set.)
- **Removed a duplicate companion.** "Golden Bulette" and "Golden Bulette Pup"
  were the same companion entered twice (once at Mythic 7.5% Outgoing Healing,
  once at Celestial 9%). Merged into **Golden Bulette Pup** — choose Celestial
  rarity for the 9% value.
- **Bard weapons — Celestial Dirgeblade added + Impending Doom set fixed.** Added
  the missing item-level 5,250 (Celestial) Dirgeblade, and corrected the Impending
  Doom 2-piece set bonus on the Bard weapons (Dirgeblade + Strings of the Forsaken):
  now **+5% Power and +7.5% Critical Strike** (was 2.5% Power / wrong crit stat).
  Also fixed the item-level 3,400 Strings, which was mislabeled — at that tier the
  set is **Whisper of Power**, not Impending Doom. (Report #151.)
