# Data Issues To Investigate

## Companion Power Scaling Issues

### Fixed-Effect Powers (No Scaling)
These powers show the same values at all rarities. Needs in-game verification — could be intentional or a display/data issue. Reports submitted to website.

- **Hank's Aim** (Hank the Ranger) — 225 magnitude bleed at all rarities. Report #3.
- **Consume Soul** (Lich Makos) — 90 magnitude + 5% heal at all rarities. Report #4.
- **Ox Stot's Instincts** (Ox Stot) — 20% stun 3s at all rarities. Report #6.
- **Elminster's Chain Lightning** (Elminster Simulacrum) — 66 mag + 16.5 chain at all rarities. Report #7.
- **Chickenmancer's Discipline** (Earl the Chickenmancer) — 10% polymorph at all rarities. Report #8.
- **I'm Just a Little Adventurer** (Eric the Cavalier) — Stun 3s + 90% threat reduction at all rarities. Report #9.
- **Doom and Bloom** (Fireblossom Zealot) — 50% chance, 10% heal at all rarities. Report #10.

- **Fiendish Charmer's Distraction** (Incubus) — 10% daze 3s at all rarities. No report submitted.
- **Succubus's Distraction** (Succubus) — Same as Incubus. No report submitted.

### Special Scaling Patterns
Powers that scale but don't follow standard single/double stat tables.

- **Igneous Skin** (Minotaur) — Reduces damage taken + increases AoE damage. Known values: screenshot showed 10%/7.5%, Celestial is 12%/12%. Non-standard scaling. Deleted bug report #5 after correction.
- **Rattigan the Wise** (Plagueborne Insight) — 4.8% Power + CA per stack at Celestial. Doesn't match standard double (4.50%). Base rarity Mythic.
- **Grace Revoir** (Unseelie Cruelty) — 5% at Mythic, 13.5% at Celestial. Big jump, doesn't match any table.
- **Vampire's Kiss** (Vampire/Vampire Bride) — 3.6% heal at Epic. Doesn't match standard tables.
- **Hollyphant's Guidance** (Lulu the Hollyphant) — DR follows double stat, heal follows single stat. Two different scales on same power.
- **Blaspheme Assassin** (Spiteful Presence) — 6% fixed necrotic + 0.75x single Crit Severity. Mixed fixed/scaling.
- **Wererat Thief** (Wererat Discipline) — Slow at 2.2x single, magnitude at 0.5x standard. Two different scales.
- **Baby Bear** (Baby Bear's Instincts) — Chance at 2x single, stats at 0.75x single. Two different scales.

### Celeste Power Name Fix
- **Celeste** — Was "Divine Answers" (Forte + Outgoing Healing), corrected to "Celeste's Wisdom" (proc heal when below 50% HP). The old "Divine Answers" power (ID 146) may still exist as orphaned data.

### Companion Name Issues
- **Watler** — Was "Wailer" in data, corrected to Watler.
- **Portalhound** — Was "Portalerhound" in data, corrected.
- **Conartist** — Was "Con Artist" in data, in-game shows "Conartist's Discipline".
- **Undying Overlord** (Lich) — Was "Undying Overbound" in data, corrected.
- **Fire Eye** — Removed as duplicate of Blue Fire Eye.
- **Phasespider** — Was assigned wrong power (Phasespider's Instincts = Little White's power). Fixed to Phasespider's Presence.

### Missing Companion Data
- **Little White** — New companion added. Has Phasespider's Instincts (Utility, 3 stats). Enhancement ref not set.
- **Celeste** — New power created (Celeste's Wisdom, ID 259). Verify proc heal scaling matches in-game.
- **Apprentice Healer** — Fixed from IL 75 to IL 150. Has Max HP + Incoming Healing (uses flat HP scaling table).

### Max HP Scaling Table
Used by multiple companions. Verified from in-game screenshots:
- Com: 1,500 | Unc: 3,000 | Rar: 5,000 | Epi: 7,500 | Leg: 11,000 | Myc: 15,000 | Cel: 18,000
- 2x Max HP table (Energon): 3,000 | 6,000 | 10,000 | 15,000 | 22,000 | 30,000 | 36,000
